# Encryption and Decryption Program

This repository contains a simple encryption and decryption program written in C++.

## Encryption Program

The encryption program, named `main1.cpp`, can encrypt user-input English text and represent the encrypted result in hexadecimal format.

## Decryption Program

The decryption program, named `main2.cpp`, can decrypt the text encrypted by the encryption program, restoring the original text.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/LZRui2024/Encrypt-d.git

2. Run the encryption program:

   - Execute the provided executable `main1.exe`.
   - Follow the prompts to input English text for encryption.

3. Run the decryption program:

   - Execute the provided executable `main2.exe`.
   - Follow the prompts to input the encrypted text for decryption.

Alternatively, if you prefer to compile the source code:

   - Compile `main1.cpp` using a C++ compiler to create the encryption executable.
   - Compile `main2.cpp` using a C++ compiler to create the decryption executable.
   - Run the generated executables as described above.

## Notes

- This program provides basic encryption functionality and does not guarantee absolute data security.
- Please note that this program can only encrypt English text; other languages cannot be encrypted.
